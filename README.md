# PyBer_Analysis
### Purpose and Reason

  The purpose of the assignment was to show the key metrics for the ride-sharing data by type and to create a multi-line graph that shows the total fares for each week by city type. These results will allow for the CEO to make data driven decisions and know which city type to support with either more funding or resources. The first technical delivery summed data by each city type to easily compare. Urban has the most demand and generates the most money, but also the most drivers which led to a more cost-efficient average fare per ride for the consumer but also the smallest average fare per driver. The total fare by city type analyzed weekly showed similar trends across the city types with spikes happening at the end of Feb and beginning of March for Rural and Suburban. The data was analyzed by creating specific Dataframes, then filtered and pivoted to get the results in visual formats that is easy to comprehend.

### Challenges and Difficulties

  I had difficulty creating the pivot table. The steps above this were to create a new Dataframe which I did not think was necessary and pivoted the created data frame in the previous steps. In a job, there will be many follow up questions from your boss or CEO that you didn’t think to investigate so it’s good to have a comprehensive understanding of all the date and ways that it can be analyzed. There were a few steps that did not seem necessary  but overall, I was able to create both charts and linear graph without much difficulty. Thankful that my Google search skill is getting stronger with each challenge and access to TAs.
  
  ### Recommendations and Further Investigation
  I would recommend to the CEO to add codes and discounts to increase total rides for the rural and suburban city type to get the average fare per ride closer to urban results. I would also recommend doing more investigation as to why the total fares is higher for rural and suburban compared to urban. Are the rides longer? Is there a surcharge happening that is skewing the total? Does the fare include tips? I would suggest a stronger review of the ‘Fares’ column, but we’d need access to more data than what was provided like ride length. Also, was the cost per mile the same across all city types. Urban has the largest amount of data. I would also be interested to see what the total fares would be if each city type had the same number of rides.
